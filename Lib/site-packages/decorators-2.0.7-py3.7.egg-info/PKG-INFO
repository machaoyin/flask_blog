Description: # Decorators
        
        ## The problem
        
        Python has a few forms for decorators, you can have a plain simple decorator, with no arguments:
        
        ```python
        @mydecorator
        def foo(): pass
        ```
        
        Or a decorator with some arguments:
        
        ```python
        @mydecorator(1, 2)
        def foo(): pass
        ```
        
        You can even decorate a class:
        
        ```python
        @mydecorator
        class Foo(object): pass
        ```
        
        and each form is a little different to implement. This was frustrating if you wanted to create easy to use decorators where the developer didn't need to worry about `@mydecorator()` working differently than `@mydecorator`.
        
        
        ## decorators module
        
        The `decorators.Decorator` class allows you to easily create broad decorators that encompass all forms and all types (functions, methods, classes) using the same interface:
        
        ```python
        import decorators
        
        class mydecorator(decorators.Decorator):
            def decorate_func(self, func, *dec_args, **dec_kwargs):
                def decorator(*args, *kwargs):
                    print("You passed into the decorator these arguments", dec_args, dec_kwargs)
                    print("You passed into your function these arguments", args, kwargs)
                    print("Your function is", func)
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)
        
                return decorator
        
            def decorate_class(self, klass, *dec_args, **dec_kwargs):
                print("You passed into the decorator these arguments", dec_args, dec_kwargs)
                print("Your class is", klass)
                return klass
        ```
        
        You can then use this decorator:
        
        ```python
        @mydecorator
        def foo(): print "foo()"
        
        @mydecorator(1, 2, boom="blam")
        def bar(*args, **kwargs): print "bar()"
        
        @mydecorator
        class Baz(object): pass
        
        @mydecorator(1, 2, boom="blam")
        class Che(object): pass
        ```
        
        Now, your decorator can decorate functions or classes, pass in arguments, or not, and you never have to worry about the subtle differences between the decorators, and best of all, you don't have to duplicate code.
        
        
        ## Other decorators
        
        ### FuncDecorator, ClassDecorator, and InstanceDecorator
        
        The `Decorator` class is good if you want to create a decorator that is totally flexible, if you want to enforce your decorator only being used for a function/method, you can use `FuncDecorator`. If you want to only decorate a class, use `ClassDecorator`, and if you want to decorate every instance of a class, use `InstanceDecorator`.
        
        Whatever child class you use, you override the `decorate` method to return your decorator function:
        
        ```python
        import decorators
        
        class only_func(FuncDecorator):
            def decorate(self, func, *dec_a, **dec_kw):
                def decorator(*args, **kwargs):
                    return func(*args, **kwargs)
                return decorator
        
        # this will work
        @only_func
        def foo(): pass
        
        # this will fail
        @only_func
        class Foo(object): pass
        ```
        
        
        ### Property Decorator
        
        The `property` decorator is a drop-in replacement for Python's built-in `property` decorator, with additional functionality:
        
        ```python
        from decorators import property
        
        class Foo(object):
            @property
            def bar(self):
                """This will act just like python's built-in @property decorator"""
                return 1
                
            @property(cached="_che")
            def che(self):
                """This will cache the return value into _che and add a setter/deleter"""
                return 1
        ```
        
        
        ### Classproperty Decorator
        
        Allows you to create a property on the class:
        
        ```python
        from decorators import classproperty
        
        class Foo(object):
            @classproperty
            def bar(cls):
                """Available as Foo.bar"""
                return 1
                
        print(Foo.bar) # 1
        ```
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use pip:
        
            pip install decorators
        
        Or, to get the latest and greatest from source:
        
            pip install -U "git+https://github.com/Jaymon/decorators#egg=decorators"
